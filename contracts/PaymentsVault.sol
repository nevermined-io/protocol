/**
 * @title PaymentsVault
 * @author Nevermined AG
 * @notice This contract serves as a secure vault for holding and managing native tokens (ETH) and ERC20 tokens
 * in the Nevermined ecosystem.
 * @dev The contract implements:
 * - Role-based access control via OpenZeppelin's AccessManager integration
 * - Security against reentrancy attacks via ReentrancyGuardTransientUpgradeable
 * - Upgradeability using UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern
 * - ERC-7201 namespaced storage pattern to prevent storage collisions during upgrades
 *
 * The contract handles two main token types:
 * 1. Native tokens (ETH)
 * 2. ERC20 tokens
 *
 * Access is controlled via two primary roles:
 * - DEPOSITOR_ROLE: Allows depositing tokens into the vault
 * - WITHDRAW_ROLE: Allows withdrawing tokens from the vault
