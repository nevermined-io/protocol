/**
 * @title DistributePaymentsCondition
 * @author Nevermined
 * @notice Condition for distributing previously locked payments based on agreement outcomes
 * @dev This contract handles the final distribution of funds that were previously locked
 * by the LockPaymentCondition. The distribution can result in either:
 * 1. Successful execution: Payments are distributed to the intended receivers according to the plan
 * 2. Failed execution: Payments are refunded to the original sender (agreement creator)
 *
 * The condition works in tandem with LockPaymentCondition (prerequisite) and typically checks
 * if a release condition (e.g., TransferCreditsCondition) has been fulfilled before distributing
 * payments. This ensures the payment workflow maintains atomicity in the Nevermined protocol.
