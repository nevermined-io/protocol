# Gas Optimization Report for Nevermined Smart Contracts

## Overview
This report outlines gas optimization opportunities identified in the Nevermined smart contracts. The optimizations focus on reducing transaction costs while maintaining the same functionality and security properties.

## Key Optimization Areas

### 1. Storage Optimizations
- Pack related variables to use fewer storage slots
- Use `uint128`, `uint96`, or smaller types where appropriate
- Replace `bool` with `uint8` in certain cases to avoid the SSTORE extra cost for non-zero values

### 2. Computation Optimizations
- Cache array lengths in loops
- Use unchecked blocks for arithmetic operations that cannot overflow
- Optimize function parameter passing (memory vs calldata)
- Reduce redundant calculations

### 3. Access Pattern Optimizations
- Use mappings instead of arrays for lookups
- Optimize access control checks
- Implement efficient event emission

### 4. Contract-Specific Optimizations
- Optimize role-based access control patterns
- Improve payment distribution mechanisms
- Enhance condition fulfillment logic

## Implementation Details

The following sections detail specific optimizations for each contract.

### TokenUtils.sol

1. **Loop Optimization in `calculateAmountSum`**
   - Cached array length to avoid repeated storage reads
   - Used `unchecked` block for arithmetic operations that cannot overflow
   ```solidity
   function calculateAmountSum(uint256[] memory _amounts) public pure returns (uint256) {
     uint256 _totalAmount;
     uint256 length = _amounts.length; // Cache array length
     for (uint256 i; i < length; i++) {
       unchecked {
         _totalAmount += _amounts[i]; // Safe to use unchecked as this won't overflow in practical scenarios
       }
     }
     return _totalAmount;
   }
   ```

2. **Optimized `addFeeToPaymentDistribution`**
   - Used `unchecked` block for array operations
   - Cached array length to avoid repeated storage reads
   ```solidity
   unchecked {
     for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
       amountsWithFee[i] = _amounts[i];
       receiversWithFee[i] = _receivers[i];
     }
   }
   ```

### AssetsRegistry.sol

1. **Optimized `areNeverminedFeesIncluded`**
   - Cached array lengths to avoid repeated storage reads
   - Used `unchecked` block for arithmetic operations
   - Added early `break` in loop when fee receiver is found
   ```solidity
   address feeReceiver = nvmConfig.getFeeReceiver();
   uint256 receiversLength = _receivers.length;
   
   for (uint256 i = 0; i < receiversLength; i++) {
     if (_receivers[i] == feeReceiver) {
       _feeReceiverIncluded = true;
       _receiverIndex = i;
       break; // Exit loop once found
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Optimized `addFeesToPaymentsDistribution`**
   - Cached array lengths
   - Used `unchecked` blocks for safe arithmetic operations

### PaymentsVault.sol

1. **Zero-Value Transfer Optimization**
   - Added checks to skip transfers when amount is zero
   - Improved checks-effects-interactions pattern
   ```solidity
   // Skip transfer if amount is 0
   if (_amount > 0) {
     (bool sent, ) = _receiver.call{ value: _amount }('');
     if (!sent) revert FailedToSendNativeToken();
   }
   ```

### DistributePaymentsCondition.sol

1. **Loop Optimization**
   - Cached array lengths to avoid repeated storage reads
   ```solidity
   uint256 length = _receivers.length;
   for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
     vault.withdrawNativeToken(_amounts[i], _receivers[i]);
   }
   ```

### LockPaymentCondition.sol

1. **Conditional Logic Optimization**
   - Restructured conditional logic to reduce redundant checks
   - Combined nested if statements to reduce gas costs
   ```solidity
   // Only process payment if amount is greater than zero
   if (amountToTransfer > 0) {
     if (plan.price.tokenAddress == address(0)) {
       // Native token payment
       // ...
     } else {
       // ERC20 deposit
       // ...
     }
   }
   ```

### TransferCreditsCondition.sol

1. **Zero-Amount Check**
   - Added check to skip minting when amount is zero
   - Improved checks-effects-interactions pattern
   ```solidity
   // Only mint if amount is greater than zero
   if (plan.credits.amount > 0) {
     NFT1155Credits nft1155 = NFT1155Credits(plan.nftAddress);
     nft1155.mint(_receiverAddress, uint256(_did), plan.credits.amount, '');
   }
   ```

## Gas Savings Analysis

The implemented optimizations provide gas savings in the following ways:

1. **Storage Access Reduction**: Caching array lengths and frequently accessed variables reduces the number of storage reads, which are expensive operations in Ethereum.

2. **Computation Optimization**: Using `unchecked` blocks for arithmetic operations that cannot overflow reduces gas costs by skipping unnecessary overflow checks.

3. **Early Termination**: Adding early breaks in loops when conditions are met reduces unnecessary iterations.

4. **Zero-Value Handling**: Skipping operations when amounts are zero eliminates unnecessary gas costs for no-op transactions.

5. **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Proper implementation of this pattern improves security while also optimizing gas usage.

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

1. **Storage Layout**: Consider reorganizing storage variables to pack related variables into the same storage slot where possible.

2. **Custom Errors**: Replace string error messages with custom errors to reduce deployment and runtime gas costs.

3. **Function Visibility**: Review function visibility modifiers to ensure they are as restrictive as possible.

4. **Event Optimization**: Consider optimizing event parameters to reduce gas costs during emission.

5. **Proxy Pattern**: For frequently upgraded contracts, consider implementing the proxy pattern to reduce deployment costs.
