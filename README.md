# Nevermined Smart Contracts v2

> ðŸ’§ Smart Contracts implementation of Nevermined in Solidity
> [nevermined.io](https://nevermined.io)

## Overview

Nevermined Smart Contracts form the core of the Nevermined protocol, enabling secure asset registration, access control, and payment management in a decentralized environment. This protocol facilitates the entire lifecycle of digital assets, from registration and pricing to access management and payment processing.

### Key Features

- **Asset Registration**: Register digital assets with customizable access plans
- **Agreement Management**: Create and manage agreements between parties with condition-based fulfillment
- **Payment Handling**: Secure escrow and distribution of payments
- **Access Control**: NFT-based credits system for managing access rights
- **Configurable Fees**: Network fee management for platform sustainability

## Architecture

The Nevermined Smart Contracts are organized around several core components:

### Core Components

1. **NVMConfig**
   - Central registry for roles, fees, and contract addresses
   - Manages access control and permissions
   - Stores configuration parameters

2. **AssetsRegistry**
   - Manages asset registration and metadata
   - Handles access plans and pricing configurations
   - Supports different pricing models (fixed price, fiat price, smart contract price)

3. **AgreementsStore**
   - Stores and tracks agreements between parties
   - Manages condition states and fulfillment
   - Provides agreement verification

4. **PaymentsVault**
   - Escrow for holding and releasing payments
   - Supports both native tokens and ERC20 tokens
   - Manages deposit and withdrawal permissions

5. **NFT1155Credits**
   - ERC1155-based NFT implementation for access rights
   - Supports different credit types (expirable, fixed, dynamic)
   - Manages minting and burning of access tokens

### Conditions System

The protocol uses a condition-based agreement system where specific conditions must be met before payments are released or access is granted:

- **LockPaymentCondition**: Handles locking payments in escrow
- **TransferCreditsCondition**: Manages the transfer of access credits
- **DistributePaymentsCondition**: Controls payment distribution to receivers

### Agreement Templates

- **FixedPaymentTemplate**: Template for agreements with fixed payment terms

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 18.x)
- Yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nevermined-io/contracts-exp.git
cd contracts-exp

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

## Development Scripts

The project includes several scripts to help with development:

### Building and Compiling

```bash
# Clean the Hardhat environment
yarn clean

# Compile contracts
yarn compile
# or
yarn build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
yarn test

# Run integration tests
yarn test:integration

# Run tests with gas reporting
yarn test:gas

# Run test coverage
yarn coverage
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Start a local Hardhat node
yarn chain
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint Solidity code
yarn lint

# Fix linting issues
yarn lint:fix

# Format code
yarn format

# Format Solidity code
yarn prettier:solidity

# Format TypeScript code
yarn prettier:ts

# Check code with Biome
yarn biome

# Fix code with Biome
yarn biome:fix
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy contracts (general)
yarn deploy

# Deploy to local network
yarn deploy:local

# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
yarn deploy:sepolia
```

## Contract Interaction Flow

A typical interaction flow in the Nevermined protocol:

1. Asset owner registers an asset with pricing plans in the AssetsRegistry
2. Consumer creates an agreement using a template (e.g., FixedPaymentTemplate)
3. Payment is locked in the PaymentsVault (LockPaymentCondition)
4. Access credits are transferred to the consumer (TransferCreditsCondition)
5. Payments are distributed to receivers (DistributePaymentsCondition)
