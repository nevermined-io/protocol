## Overview

Nevermined Smart Contracts form the core of the Nevermined protocol, enabling secure asset registration, access control, and payment management in a decentralized environment. This protocol facilitates the entire lifecycle of digital assets, from registration and pricing to access management and payment processing.

The Nevermined protocol allows users to:

- Register digital assets with flexible pricing models
- Set up various subscription and one-time payment plans
- Manage access rights through NFT-based credit systems
- Process both cryptocurrency and fiat payments
- Establish time-limited (expirable) and fixed-amount access rights
- Execute agreements between parties with automated condition fulfillment
- Distribute payments to multiple receivers with configurable fee structures

### Key Features

- **Asset Registration**: Register digital assets with customizable access plans
- **Agreement Management**: Create and manage agreements between parties with condition-based fulfillment
- **Payment Handling**: Secure escrow and distribution of payments
- **Access Control**: NFT-based credits system for managing access rights
- **Configurable Fees**: Network fee management for platform sustainability
- **Upgradeable Contracts**: Future-proof design with UUPS pattern
- **Multi-token Support**: Native cryptocurrency and ERC20 token support
- **Role-based Access**: Granular permissions management

## Architecture

The Nevermined Smart Contracts are organized around several core components:

![Nevermined Architecture](docs/nevermined_architecture.png)

### Core Components

1. **NVMConfig**
   - Central registry for roles, fees, and contract addresses
   - Manages access control and permissions
   - Stores configuration parameters
   - Provides role-based access control for critical operations
   - Supports upgradeable contracts through UUPS pattern

2. **AssetsRegistry**
   - Manages asset registration and metadata
   - Handles access plans and pricing configurations
   - Supports different pricing models (fixed price, fiat price, smart contract price)
   - Generates unique identifiers for assets and plans
   - Validates and enforces fee structures

3. **AgreementsStore**
   - Stores and tracks agreements between parties
   - Manages condition states and fulfillment
   - Provides agreement verification
   - Tracks dependencies between conditions
   - Ensures proper sequencing of condition fulfillment

4. **PaymentsVault**
   - Escrow for holding and releasing payments
   - Supports both native tokens and ERC20 tokens
   - Manages deposit and withdrawal permissions
   - Implements secure withdrawal patterns
   - Provides balance tracking for different token types

5. **NFT1155Credits**
   - ERC1155-based NFT implementation for access rights
   - Supports different credit types (expirable, fixed, dynamic)
   - Manages minting and burning of access tokens
   - Implements time-based expiration for credits
   - Controls redemption based on configurable rules

### Conditions System

The protocol uses a condition-based agreement system where specific conditions must be met before payments are released or access is granted:

- **LockPaymentCondition**: Handles locking payments in escrow
- **TransferCreditsCondition**: Manages the transfer of access credits
- **DistributePaymentsCondition**: Controls payment distribution to receivers
- **FiatSettlementCondition**: Manages off-chain fiat payment verification

### Agreement Templates

- **FixedPaymentTemplate**: Template for agreements with fixed payment terms
- **FiatPaymentTemplate**: Template for agreements with fiat payment terms

### Contract Inheritance and Relationships

The contracts follow a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

- Core contracts manage configuration, assets, agreements, and payments
- Template contracts orchestrate the agreement creation and condition fulfillment
- Condition contracts implement specific business logic for different agreement types
- Token contracts handle the minting, burning, and tracking of access rights

### Access Control System

The protocol implements a comprehensive role-based access control system:

- **OWNER_ROLE**: Full administrative control
- **GOVERNOR_ROLE**: Configuration management
- **CREDITS_MINTER_ROLE**: Ability to mint access credits
- **CREDITS_BURNER_ROLE**: Ability to burn access credits
- **DEPOSITOR_ROLE**: Ability to deposit funds into the vault
- **WITHDRAW_ROLE**: Ability to withdraw funds from the vault
- **FIAT_SETTLEMENT_ROLE**: Ability to verify fiat payments

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 22.x)
- Yarn (>= 1.22.x)
- Git
- Foundry (for advanced testing and deployment)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nevermined-io/contracts-exp.git

# Start a local Anvil chain (Foundry)
anvil
```

### Code Quality

```bash

yarn deploy:local

# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
yarn deploy:sepolia
```

## Contract Interaction Flow

A typical interaction flow in the Nevermined protocol:

1. Asset owner registers an asset with pricing plans in the AssetsRegistry
2. Consumer creates an agreement using a template (e.g., FixedPaymentTemplate)
3. Payment is locked in the PaymentsVault (LockPaymentCondition)
4. Access credits are transferred to the consumer (TransferCreditsCondition)
5. Payments are distributed to receivers (DistributePaymentsCondition)

## Detailed Function Reference

### Asset Management

- `AssetsRegistry.register(bytes32 _didSeed, string memory _url, uint256[] memory _plans)`: Registers a new asset with associated plans
- `AssetsRegistry.createPlan(PriceConfig memory _priceConfig, CreditsConfig memory _creditsConfig, address _nftAddress)`: Creates a new pricing plan
- `AssetsRegistry.registerAssetAndPlan(...)`: Registers an asset and creates a plan in a single transaction

### Agreement Management

- `AgreementsStore.register(bytes32 _agreementId, address _agreementCreator, uint256 _planId, bytes32[] memory _conditionIds, ConditionState[] memory _conditionStates, bytes[] memory _params)`: Registers a new agreement
- `AgreementsStore.updateConditionStatus(bytes32 _agreementId, bytes32 _conditionId, ConditionState _state)`: Updates the status of a condition
- `AgreementsStore.areConditionsFulfilled(bytes32 _agreementId, bytes32 _conditionId, bytes32[] memory _dependantConditions)`: Checks if required conditions are fulfilled

### Payment Management

- `PaymentsVault.depositNativeToken()`: Deposits native tokens (ETH) to the vault
- `PaymentsVault.withdrawNativeToken(uint256 _amount, address _receiver)`: Withdraws native tokens from the vault
- `PaymentsVault.depositERC20(address _erc20TokenAddress, uint256 _amount, address _from)`: Records ERC20 token deposits
- `PaymentsVault.withdrawERC20(address _erc20TokenAddress, uint256 _amount, address _receiver)`: Withdraws ERC20 tokens from the vault

### Credits Management

- `NFT1155Credits.mint(address _to, uint256 _planId, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data)`: Mints credits for a plan
- `NFT1155ExpirableCredits.mint(address _to, uint256 _planId, uint256 _value, uint256 _secsDuration, bytes memory _data)`: Mints expirable credits
- `NFT1155Base.burn(address _from, uint256 _planId, uint256 _amount)`: Burns/redeems credits for a plan

## Upgradeability Pattern

The Nevermined contracts implement the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern:

- All storage is isolated using ERC-7201 namespaced storage pattern
- Contracts inherit from AccessManagedUUPSUpgradeable for secure upgrades
- Initialization functions replace constructors for proper proxy initialization
